The producer can send funds to the contract address before the contract creation, then they can withdraw all the balance of the contract in the first month. Let's assume that the contract's unsigned integers over/underflow and that the producer sends X funds to the contract address before contract creation and withdraws an `amount` equal to `this.balance` for the first time in the month.

`if (msg.sender != owner)`
`msg.sender` is still the owner of the contract, so we can continue to the next check.

`if (amount = 0 || amount > this.balance)`
`amount` (=`this.balance`) is not 0 and is not bigger than `this.balance`

`if (now < lastWithdrawDate + (1 months))`
we assumed that this was the first withdrawl of the month

`uint256 maxAmount = (totalSupply - this.balance + (1 ether))`
`totalSupply` is initialized in the constructor: `balances[owner] = msg.value; totalSupply = balances[owner]`, and after contract creation, we know that `this.balance` = X + `msg.value`. So upon contract creation `totalSupply` < `this.balance`.
Every time funds are sent to the contract, `totalSupply` and `this.balance` are increased accordingly.
`uint256 maxAmount = totalSupply -(totalSupply + X) + 1 ether = -X + 1 ether`, which is actually 2^256 - X + 1 ether, which is a pretty big number.

`if (amount > maxAmount)`
`this.balance` is certainly less than 2^256 - X + 1 ether, and the producer withdraws all the funds
