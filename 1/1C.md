There is still an attack that allows the producer to withdraw all of the funds in the first month after changing the second line in the constructor.
After contract creation, the attacker sends X funds to the contract through another contract that implements the `selfdestruct()` function.
This function can be used to forcefully send ether to any contract regardless of any code that may exist in the contract.
The attacker creates a contract with a `selfdestruct()` function, sends X funds to it, and then calls `selfdestruct(MovieToken.address)` to force funds into the contract without triggering the `fallback()` function.
When funds are forcibly sent to the MovieToken contract, `this.balance` increases without increasing `totalSupply`.
`uint256 maxAmount = totalSupply - this.balance + 1 ether`, results in an underflow, allowing the producer to withdraw all of the funds.
