Everything that is inside a contract is visible to all external observers. Making sth `private` only prevents other contract from accessing and modifying the information, but it will still be visible to the whole world outside of the blockchain.
`private` variables can be read by external (and pretty low-level) API's like web3.eth.getStorageAt.
