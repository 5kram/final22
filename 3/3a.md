Alice computes the hashes of h0 = h(h(T1), h(T2), h(T3)), h1 = h(h(T4), h(T5), h(T6)), and h2 = h(h(T7), h(T8), h(T9). Then, she computes the Merkle root, h3 = h(h0, h1, h2). h3 is the commitment to S.

To prove that T4 is in S, Alice needs to provide h(T5), h(T6), h0 and h2. Bob will then compute hx = h(h(T4), h(T5), h(T6)), hz = h(h0, hx, h2) and compare hz to the Merkle root, h3.
