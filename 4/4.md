function `joinGame()` and the constructor should be marked as payable.
-------------------------------------------------------------

In `playMove()` function, the contract should make sure that `squareToPlay` is played only once. To achieve that, we could add a mapping: `mapping(uint8 => bool) squareIsFilled`.
and change `playMove()` function to:
    function playMove(uint8 squareToPlay) {
        if (msg.sender != _playerAddress[_currentPlayer]) throw;
        if(!squareIsFilled[squareToPlay]) throw;            // new line
        _board[squareToPlay] = _currentPlayer;
        if (checkGameOver())
        suicide(msg.sender);
        squareIsFilled[squareToPlay] = true;            // new line
        _currentPlayer ^= 0x1;
        _turnDeadline = block.number + _turnLength;
    }
-------------------------------------------------------------

Anyone can call `defaultGame()`. The caller will get the funds of the contract.
We could create a modifier: 
modifier onlyPlayers() {
    if(msg.sender != playerAddress[0] || msg.sender != playerAddress[1]) throw;
    _;
}
and change defaultGame:
`function defaultGame() onlyPlayers {...}`
-------------------------------------------------------------

Also, player2 could withdraw the funds as soon as the contract is created, because `_turnDeadline` is initialized to 0.
To handle this, we could create a variable `bool isGameOn = false`
and a modifier:
modifier gameIsOn() {
    if(gameIsOn) throw;
    _;
}

and also change tha value of the boolean isGameOn to true when the game starts.
--------------------------------------------------------------

In`joinGame()`: we should replace `this.balance` with a variable `uint256 stake`, which will be initialized in the constructor as: `stake = msg.value`
That's because the contract could have funds before it's creation, or smo could force funds into the contract, tricking player 2 to send more funds than player 1.
