Let's assume that H:XxY -> {0,1,...,2^n-1}  (1),
H':XxY -> {0,1,...,2^m-1}   (2), 
D=2^32=>d=32 (let d be the leading zeros)	(3),
H'(x,y)=dH(x,y)     (4),
m>n+d   (5),
H(x1,y1) != H(x2,y2) (H is collision-resistant)     (6),
H(x,y) <= 2^n - 1 ==> H(x,y) < 2^n      (7),
H'(x,y) <= 2^m -1 ==> H'(x,y) < 2^m     (8)

To prove that H'(x,y) is collision-resistant: we assume that it's not. If it's not collision-reristant, the following can happen: H'(x1,y1) = H'(x2,y2), where (x1,y1) != (x2,y2). If that's true, then: H(x1,y1) = H(x2,y2), which is not true from (6). So, H'(x,y) is also collision-resistant.

To prove that H'(x,y) may not be proof-of-work secure we have to arrive at the following: H'(x,y) < 2^m/D

We know that: H'(x,y) = dH(x,y), and dH(x,y) < 2^n     (9).
from (5): n + d < m <==> n < m - d ==> 2^n < 2^(m-d) <==> 2^n < 2^m/2^d     (10)
from (3),(9),(10), it is proven that H'(x,y) < 2^m/2^d ==> H'(x,y) < 2^m/D

So, H'(x,y) is a collision-resistant function, but not proof-of-work secure.
